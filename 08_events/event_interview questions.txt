Basic Questions:
What is an event in JavaScript?

Explain the concept of events in JavaScript and how they interact with the DOM.
How do you add an event listener to an element?

Example: Describe the use of addEventListener and its syntax.
js
Copy code
element.addEventListener('click', function);
What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener?

Discuss differences such as multiple event listeners on the same element.
What are event handlers?

Explanation of the function that executes when an event is triggered.
What are common types of events in JavaScript?

List events like click, mouseover, keydown, submit, etc.
How do you prevent the default behavior of an event?

Example: Using event.preventDefault() to stop the default action of a form submission or link click.
What is event propagation?

Explain event capturing, bubbling, and how the event goes through the DOM hierarchy.
What is event delegation?

Describe how event delegation allows a single handler to manage events for multiple child elements, often using event bubbling.
Intermediate Questions:
How does event bubbling work in JavaScript?

Explain the concept of event bubbling and how an event propagates from the target element to the root of the DOM.
How can you stop event propagation?

Example: Using event.stopPropagation() to prevent an event from propagating up the DOM tree.
What is the difference between event.target and event.currentTarget?

Discuss the difference between the element that triggered the event and the element on which the event listener is attached.
What are synthetic events in React?

Explain how React's synthetic events work compared to native JavaScript events.
What are the parameters for addEventListener?

Discuss how to use options such as { once: true }, { passive: true }, and { capture: true }.
How do you remove an event listener?

Example: Using removeEventListener to unbind an event listener from an element.
How do you implement event delegation in JavaScript?

Show how to use event delegation with an example, like handling a click event on multiple list items via the parent element.
Advanced Questions:
How do you handle touch events for mobile devices in JavaScript?

Describe handling touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events.
How would you throttle or debounce an event listener in JavaScript?

Explain the difference between throttling and debouncing, and show how they are applied to events like scroll or resize.
How does passive event listener optimization work?

Discuss how { passive: true } helps in improving performance by informing the browser that the event listener will not call preventDefault().
What is the purpose of e.stopImmediatePropagation()?

Explain how this method stops the event from propagating and also prevents any other listeners of the same event on the current element from being called.
How do custom events work in JavaScript?

Example: Explain how to create and dispatch custom events using the CustomEvent constructor.
How can you handle complex drag-and-drop events in JavaScript?

Discuss handling dragstart, dragover, drop, and how these events can be used to implement drag-and-drop functionality.
What is the once option in addEventListener?

Discuss how to make an event listener execute only once and then automatically remove itself.
By preparing for these questions, you'll have a strong foundation in JavaScript event handling concepts and be ready for different levels of interview challenges.
